# VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing using Router-on-a-Stick

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of VLANs and Inter-VLAN routing using the Router-on-a-Stick technique in Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is segmented into multiple VLANs, and communication between them is enabled using router sub-interfaces with IEEE 802.1Q encapsulation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create multiple VLANs on a Layer 2 switch
- Assign switch ports to specific VLANs
- Configure trunking between switch and router
- Implement Inter-VLAN routing using a single router interface
- Verify communication between devices in different VLANs

---

## 🧠 Network Design
- **VLAN 10 – IT Department**
- **VLAN 20 – HR Department**
- **Switch:** Cisco 2960
- **Router:** Cisco PT Router
- **Routing Method:** Router-on-a-Stick

## 🖥️ IP Addressing Scheme

| Device | VLAN | IP Address | Subnet Mask | Gateway |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| PC0 | 10 | 192.168.10.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC1 | 20 | 192.168.20.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.20.1 |
| Router G0/0/0.10 | 10 | 192.168.10.1 | 255.255.255.0 | — |
| Router G0/0/0.20 | 20 | 192.168.20.1 | 255.255.255.0 | — |
