# VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates VLAN configuration and Inter-VLAN routing
using Router-on-a-Stick method in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Network Topology
- 1 Router (PT-8200)
- 1 Switch (2960)
- 2 VLANs
  - VLAN 10 (IT) - 192.168.10.0/24
  - VLAN 20 (HR) - 192.168.20.0/24

## Technologies Used
- VLAN
- Trunking (802.1Q)
- Sub-interfaces
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Configuration Highlights
- Router sub-interfaces configured with dot1Q encapsulation
- Switch ports assigned to respective VLANs
- Successful communication between VLANs

## Result
PCs from different VLANs can communicate through the router.
